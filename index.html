                <h3>What is a perfect diet all about?</h3>
                <p>
               
                Everybody in this busy life, don't bother about personal heath. But it is scientifically proven that a
                healthy diet makes a person most effective and improves immunity. According to studies, a normal person
                should atleast take a given amount of proteins, carbs , fats(good fat) and various vitamins. A healthy
                diet doesn't really mean you shouldn't eat junk or oily foods. A healthy diet is biased with nunber of
                "calories" a person is taking and what amount of it is being burnt in 24hrs time span.

                Answer to the question is very simple, there is more than enough calories calculator which calculates amount of calories to be taken by a person in accordance with their weight and fat percentaage.
