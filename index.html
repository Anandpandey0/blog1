        Like everyone I am also into Netflix Series very much.
        There was a time when I was so much obessed with these things that I used to spend half of my time watching
        series.
        And top of that I personally watch in one go, avoiding the suspense building for next episode.</div>
        <div class="body-items">
        First series that I watched was sucide,love genre series name "13 reasons Why?". At the very beginning I gained
        interest. So, I didn't cared about anything and just kept watching.I have completed its season-1 in a day or
        two. Then my obession picked up and I was unstoppable.
        Then I watched some other series named- "Stranger Things" , "Lucifer" , "Breaking Bad" , "Vampire Diaries"
        etc.</div>
        <div class="body-items">
        In these series I loved "You" , "Vampire Diaries". I personally link love genre series so mine are these.<br>
        After wasting 2 years in this , now I understood that series are meant to be watched one episode a day not a season a day.
        Currently, I am watching Kota factory season-2 (released recently).
        But this time one episode a day or two.</div>
